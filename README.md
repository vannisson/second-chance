# Second Chance

Second-Chance algorithm is actually a FIFO replacement algorithm with a small modification that causes it to approximate LRU. In the Second Chance page replacement policy, the candidate pages for removal are considered in a round robin matter, and a page that has been accessed between consecutive considerations will not be replaced.
